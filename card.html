    <p><i>The <strong>wolf</strong> or <strong>Canis lupus</strong> is one of the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It has a long history of association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Best know for it super powers they can run incredibly fast if they want to,  Their hearing is over 16 times better then humans. And their sense of smell is over 100 times better.</i></p>
